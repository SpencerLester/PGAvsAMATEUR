# Differences in yardage for PGA, LGPA, and Amateur Golfers by Club type


Motivation

I have been extremely interested in golf for several years, and one of the most interesting parts about golf to me is the large difference in performance, equipment, and types of courses that separate the professionals from the average weekend golfer. For my personal dataset project, I set out to find the differences in yardage based on club type amongst PGA, LGPA, and Amateur golfers. This data is from 2019, so the numbers would be slightly less then compared to 2021 simply because as technology increases, distance usually does as well. Also, golfers such as Bryson DeChambeau have been in the spotlight due to some of the longest drives ever seen on the PGA Tour that are encouraging golfers of all types to swing faster.  

Data Source

I was able to use data from https://www.foresightsports.com/blog/2019-golf-performance-average-baselines as a baseline when comparing the data to other sources to see what was deemed most useful. The data was listed in ranges of about 50 to 75 yards, but for the purpose of this project I averaged out the range to create one single value for each club and level of golfer. 

Visualization

All the charts that I made were bar graphs. Originally, I had planned to make scatter plots for each skill level, but It did not give a good comparative aspect that I thought would be beneficial for the viewer to have. Furthermore, after putting all the data on one graph it became extremely messy, so I decided to split it up based on the club type so that it was easy to read and understand. 

Throughout all the graphs the common trend is that PGA golfers hit farther than both LGPA and Amateur golfers while LGPA hits farther than the Amateurs. This is what I expected, but I found some interesting aspects while working with the data that needed further explanation. For instance, the average driving distance for the PGA was 285 yards compared to 230 for an amateur. Furthermore, PGA golfers averaged nearly 40-50 yards more per club over an amateur while the LGPA averaged 15-25 yards more. 

Another interesting aspect is the yardage distances for each club for each skill level. Typically, golfers want to have a consistent gap in yardages in their irons (usually 10 yards). PGA tour players had a 15-yard gap in their long irons (3-6) but had a 10-yard gap in their short irons (7-9) while LGPA golfers had gaps ranging from 5 to 20 yards. Surprisingly, amateur golfers had the most consistent yardage gap 10 yards for each of their irons. 

Analysis

As stated above, LGPA players had the most inconsistent gap in yardages with outliers that included 5 yards and even 20 yards. To figure out why, I had to dive deeper and do some research. According to Andrew Tursky, the inconsistency has to do with the flex of the shaft the LGPA golfers use. Women typically swing slower than men, meaning they have a shaft with more flex that is more likely to give inconsistent swing speeds which explains the outliers.
 Next, I wanted to learn more about why PGA golfers hit the ball so much farther than everyone else. Of course, their near perfect technique is a large part of it but there is also more to it. Fortunately, I work at a golf course and have access to all sorts of equipment. I was able to test the angles of amateur clubs vs. PGA Tour sets and found that there is a near 3-degree difference in loft for PGA equipment. Less loft equals more distance, which explains why PGA tour players can hit an iron on average 35 yards farther than an amateur.
